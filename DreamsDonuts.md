## Overview

The Dreams Donuts Command Application is a web-based tool that allows users to manage and track donuts in a production environment. It includes features for:

- Managing donut production
- Updating weekly donut selections
- Viewing donut statistics
- Adding new donuts
- Uploading and replacing donut images
- Generating CSV reports

### Shop and Production Layout

**Problem Statement:**

The shop and production areas are on separate levels:
- **Level 0:** The shop where customers can access from the street.
- **Level 1:** The production area where donuts are made.

Currently, there is no practical communication between the shop and the production area except via a staircase and a phone. This setup can lead to inefficiencies and delays in communication.

**Proposed Solution:**

The Dreams Donuts Command Application aims to bridge this communication gap by providing a centralized digital platform. This application allows the shop and production teams to communicate more effectively and manage production needs without relying solely on physical or verbal methods.
